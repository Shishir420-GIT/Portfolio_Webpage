            🎓 What I am is skilled Automation Developer, currently working at Wipro, where I have been actively involved in
            automating tasks for our global customers, resulting in increased productivity and reduced manual efforts
            with a passion for writing code, troubleshooting, and developing strategies
        </p>

        <p>
            📚 Have always been an active member of taking the initiative within the team since college to my current
            organization. Have always been blessed to be working with cooperative people, which led to great outcomes.
            📈Worked with global customers in the initial days of my career in managing their servers. Now working with
            the central team of my organization in making the same customers reduce their manual efforts via Automation
            and increase productivity.

            💻 Looking to the future, I am committed to advancing my skills and knowledge in the tech industry so that I
            can eventually lead and mentor a team. My ultimate goal is to continue learning and growing both personally
            and professionally.

            🏋🏽 Outside of work, you can find me at the gym or exploring the city's monuments and cuisine. I am always
            up for a challenge and enjoy pushing myself to achieve new goals.

            💪🏽 Great at adaptation to the environment, Quick learner, Focused and I talk less.
